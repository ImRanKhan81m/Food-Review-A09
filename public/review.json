      "about": "sylvia's is easy to use and just delicious… you can just wet the chicken and throw it in a baggie with the seasoning and shake and fry or put in your air fryer.. easy. It even tastes a bit more spicy the second day! Have been using sylvia's for years and haven’t come across anything better!",
